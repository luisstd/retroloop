          <h3>Intellectual Property</h3>
          <p>
            The intellectual property in the materials contained in this website are owned by or
            licensed to Retroloop and are protected by applicable copyright and trademark law. We
            grant our users permission to download one copy of the materials for personal,
            non-commercial transitory use.
          </p>
          <p>
            This constitutes the grant of a license, not a transfer of title. This license shall
            automatically terminate if you violate any of these restrictions or the Terms of
            Service, and may be terminated by Retroloop at any time.
          </p>
          <h3>Liability</h3>
          <p>
            Our website and the materials on our website are provided on an &apos;as is&apos; basis.
            To the extent permitted by law, Retroloop makes no warranties, expressed or implied, and
            hereby disclaims and negates all other warranties including, without limitation, implied
            warranties or conditions of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, or
            non-infringement of intellectual property, or other violation of rights.
          </p>
          <p>
            In no event shall Retroloop or its suppliers be liable for any consequential loss
            suffered or incurred by you or any third party arising from the use or inability to use
            this website or the materials on this website, even if Retroloop or an authorized
            representative has been notified, orally or in writing, of the possibility of such
            damage.
          </p>
          <p>
            In the context of this agreement, &quot;consequential loss&quot; includes any
            consequential loss, indirect loss, real or anticipated loss of profit, loss of benefit,
            loss of revenue, loss of business, loss of goodwill, loss of opportunity, loss of
            savings, loss of reputation, loss of use and/or loss or corruption of data, whether
            under statute, contract, equity, tort (including negligence), indemnity or otherwise.
          </p>
          <p>
            Because some jurisdictions do not allow limitations on implied warranties, or
            limitations of liability for consequential or incidental damages, these limitations may
            not apply to you.

            website.
          </p>
          <h3>Links</h3>

            Retroloop has not reviewed all of the sites linked to its website and is not responsible
            for the contents of any such linked site. The inclusion of any link does not imply

            Service immediately upon written notice to you for any breach of these Terms of Service.
          </p>
          <h3>Severance</h3>
          <p>
            Any term of these Terms of Service which is wholly or partially void or unenforceable is
            severed to the extent that it is void or unenforceable. The validity of the remainder of
            these Terms of Service is not affected.
          </p>
          <h3>Governing Law</h3>

          <h2>Retroloop Acceptable Use Policy</h2>
          <p>
            This acceptable use policy covers the products, services, and technologies (collectively
            referred to as the &quot;Products&quot;) provided by Retroloop under any ongoing
            agreement. It&apos;s designed to protect us, our customers and the general Internet
            community from unethical, irresponsible and illegal activity.
          </p>
          <p>
            Retroloop customers found engaging in activities prohibited by this acceptable use
            policy can be liable for service suspension and account termination. In extreme cases,
            we may be legally obliged to report such customers to the relevant authorities.
          </p>
          <p>This policy was last reviewed on 29 October 2023.</p>
          <h3>Fair use</h3>
          <p>
            We provide our facilities with the assumption your use will be &quot;business as
            usual&quot;, as per our offer schedule. If your use is considered to be excessive, then
            additional fees may be charged or capacity may be restricted.
          </p>
          <p>
            We are opposed to all forms of abuse, discrimination, rights infringement and/or any
            action that harms or disadvantages any group, individual or resource. We expect our
            customers and, where applicable, their users (&quot;end-users&quot;) to likewise engage
            our Products with similar intent.
          </p>
          <h3>Customer accountability</h3>
          <p>
            We regard our customers as being responsible for their own actions as well as for the
            actions of anyone using our Products with the customer&apos;s permission. This
            responsibility also applies to anyone using our Products on an unauthorized basis as a
            result of the customer&apos;s failure to put in place reasonable security measures.
          </p>
          <p>
            By accepting Products from us, our customers agree to ensure adherence to this policy on
            behalf of anyone using the Products as their end users. Complaints regarding the actions
            of customers or their end-users will be forwarded to the nominated contact for the
            account in question.
          </p>
          <p>
            If a customer — or their end-user or anyone using our Products as a result of the
            customer — violates our acceptable use policy, we reserve the right to terminate any
            Products associated with the offending account or the account itself or take any
            remedial or preventative action we deem appropriate without notice. To the extent
            permitted by law, no credit will be available for interruptions of service resulting
            from any violation of our acceptable use policy.
          </p>
          <h3>Prohibited activity</h3>
          <h4>Copyright infringement and access to unauthorized material</h4>
          <p>

            <li>
              any material that is obscene, defamatory, constitutes an illegal threat or violates
              export control laws.

          </ol>
          <p>
            The customer is solely responsible for all material they input, upload, disseminate,

            or hosted by our Products must be &quot;confirmed opt-in&quot;. Verification of the
            address or telephone number owner&apos;s express permission must be available for the
            lifespan of the messaging list.
          </p>
          <p>
            We prohibit the use of email lists, telephone number lists or databases purchased from
            third parties intended for spam or unconfirmed messaging list purposes on our Products.
          </p>
          <p>
            This spam and unauthorized message activity policy applies to messages sent using our
            Products, or to messages sent from any network by the customer or any person on the
            customer&apos;s behalf, that directly or indirectly refer the recipient to a site hosted
            via our Products.
          </p>

            Our Products must not be used for the purpose of advertising, transmitting or otherwise

          </p>
          <p>
            Our Products must not be used to access any account or electronic resource where the
            group or individual attempting to gain access does not own or is not authorized to
