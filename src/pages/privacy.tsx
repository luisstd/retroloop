          includes information about you as a person (such as name, address, and date of birth),
          your devices, payment details, and even information about how you use a website or online
          service.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the event our site contains links to third-party sites and services, please be aware
          that those sites and services have their own privacy policies. After following a link to
          any third-party content, you should read their posted privacy policy information about how
          they collect and use personal information. This Privacy Policy does not apply to any of
          your activities after you leave our site.
        </p>
        <p>This policy is effective as of 28 January 2023</p>
        <p>Last updated: 29 October 2023</p>
        <h3>Information We Collect</h3>
        <p>
          Information we collect falls into one of two categories: “voluntarily provided”

        </p>
        <p>
          “Voluntarily provided” information refers to any information you knowingly and actively
          provide us when using or participating in any of our services and promotions.

          time spent on each page, and other details about your visit.
        </p>
        <p>
          Additionally, if you encounter certain errors while using the site, we may automatically
          collect data about the error and the circumstances surrounding its occurrence. This data
          may include technical details about your device, what you were trying to do when the error
          happened, and other technical information relating to the problem. You may or may not
          receive notice of such errors, even in the moment they occur, that they have occurred, or
          what the nature of the error is.
        </p>
        <p>
          Please be aware that while this information may not be personally identifying by itself,
          it may be possible to combine it with other data to personally identify individual
          persons.

        <p>
          We may combine voluntarily provided and automatically collected personal information with
          general information or research data we receive from other trusted sources. For example,
          If you provide us with your location, we may combine this with general information about
          currency and language to provide you with an enhanced experience of our site and service.

        <h4>Security of Your Personal Information</h4>
        <p>
          When we collect and process personal information, and while we retain this information, we
          will protect it within commercially acceptable means to prevent loss and theft, as well as
          unauthorized access, disclosure, copying, use or modification.
        </p>
        <p>
          Although we will do our best to protect the personal information you provide to us, we
          advise that no method of electronic transmission or storage is 100% secure and no one can
          guarantee absolute data security.
        </p>
        <p>
          You are responsible for selecting any password and its overall security strength, ensuring
          the security of your own information within the bounds of our services. For example,
          ensuring any passwords associated with accessing your personal information and accounts
          are secure and confidential.
        </p>
        <h4>How Long We Keep Your Personal Information</h4>
        <p>
          We keep your personal information only for as long as we need to. This time period may
          depend on what we are using your information for, in accordance with this privacy policy.
          For example, if you have provided us with personal information as part of creating an
          account with us, we may retain this information for the duration your account exists on
          our system. If your personal information is no longer required for this purpose, we will
          delete it or make it anonymous by removing all details that identify you.

          However, if necessary, we may retain your personal information for our compliance with a
          legal, accounting, or reporting obligation or for archiving purposes in the public

          relationship with us is mainly for personal, family, or household purposes, you may ask us
          about the information we release to other organizations for their marketing purposes. In
          accordance with your right to non-discrimination, we may offer you certain financial
          incentives permitted by the California Consumer Privacy Act, and the California Privacy
          Rights Act (collectively, CCPA) that can result in different prices, rates, or quality
          levels for the goods or services we provide. Any CCPA-permitted financial incentive we
          offer will reasonably relate to the value of your personal information, and we will
          provide written terms that describe clearly the nature of such an offer. Participation in
          a financial incentive program requires your prior opt-in consent, which you may revoke at
          any time.
