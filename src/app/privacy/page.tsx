      <h4>
        International Transfers Outside of the European Economic Area (EEA)
      </h4>
      <p>
        We will ensure that any transfer of personal information from countries
        in the European Economic Area (EEA) to countries outside the EEA will be
        protected by appropriate safeguards, for example by using standard data
        protection clauses approved by the European Commission, or the use of
        binding corporate rules or other legally accepted means.
      </p>
      <h4>Your Rights and Controlling Your Personal Information</h4>
      <p>
        <strong>Restrict:</strong> You have the right to request that we
        restrict the processing of your personal information if (i) you are
        concerned about the accuracy of your personal information; (ii) you
        believe your personal information has been unlawfully processed; (iii)
        you need us to maintain the personal information solely for the purpose
        of a legal claim; or (iv) we are in the process of considering your
        objection in relation to processing on the basis of legitimate
        interests.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Objecting to processing:</strong> You have the right to object
        to processing of your personal information that is based on our
        legitimate interests or public interest. If this is done, we must
        provide compelling legitimate grounds for the processing which overrides
        your interests, rights, and freedoms, in order to proceed with the
        processing of your personal information.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Right to be Informed:</strong> You have the right to be informed
        with how your data is collected, processed, shared and stored.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Right of Access:</strong> You may request a copy of the personal
        information that we hold about you at any time by submitting a Data
        Subject Access Request (DSAR). The statutory deadline for fulfilling a
        DSAR request is 30 calendar days from our receipt of your request.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Right to Erasure:</strong> In certain circumstances, you can ask
        for your personal data to be erased from the records held by
        organisations. However this is a qualified right; it is not absolute,
        and may only apply in certain circumstances.
      </p>
      <p>When may the right to erasure apply?</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          When the personal data is no longer necessary for the purpose for
          which it was originally collected or processed for.
        </li>
        <li>
          If consent was the lawful basis for processing personal data and that
          consent has been withdrawn. Noisia Labs OÜ relies on consent to
          process personal data in very few circumstances.
        </li>
        <li>
          The Company is relying on legitimate interests as a legal basis for
          processing personal data and an individual has exercised the right to
          object and it has been determined that the Company has no overriding
          legitimate grounds to refuse that request.
        </li>
        <li>
          Personal data are being processed for direct marketing purposes e.g. a
          person&apos;s name and email address, and the individual objects to
          that processing.
        </li>
        <li>
          There is legislation that requires that personal data are to be
          destroyed.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <strong>Right to Portability:</strong> Individuals have the right to get
        some of their personal data from an organisation in a way that is
        accessible and machine-readable, for example as a csv file. Associated
        with this, individuals also have the right to ask an organisation to
        transfer their personal data to another organisation.
      </p>
      <p>However, the right to portability:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          only applies to personal data which a person has directly given to
          Noisia Labs OÜ in electronic form; and
        </li>
        <li>
          onward transfer will only be available where this is &quot;technically
          feasible&quot;.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <strong>Right to Rectification:</strong> If personal data is inaccurate,
        out of date, or incomplete, individuals have the right to correct,
        update or complete that data. Collectively this is referred to as the
        right to rectification. Rectification may involve filling the gaps i.e.
        to have to have incomplete personal data completed – although this will
        depend on the purposes for the processing. This may involve adding a
        supplementary statement to the incomplete data to highlight any
        inaccuracy or claim thereof.
      </p>
      <p>
        This right only applies to an individual&apos;s own personal data; a
        person cannot seek the rectification of another person&apos;s
        information.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Notification of data breaches:</strong> Upon discovery of a data
        breach, we will investigate the incident and report it to the UK&apos;s
        data protection regulator and yourself, if we deem it appropriate to do
        so.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Complaints:</strong> You have the right, at any time, to lodge a
        complaint with the Information Commissioner&apos;s Office (ICO), the UK
        supervisory authority for data protection issues (www.ico.org.uk). We
        would, however, appreciate the chance to deal with your concerns before
        you approach the ICO so please contact us in the first instance using
        the details below. Please provide us with as much information as you can
        about the alleged breach. We will promptly investigate your complaint
        and respond to you, in writing, setting out the outcome of our
        investigation and the steps we will take to deal with your complaint.

      <h3>
        Additional Disclosures for Personal Information Protection and
        Electronic Documents Act (PIPEDA) Compliance (Canada)
      </h3>
      <h4>Additional scope of personal information</h4>
      <p>
        In accordance with PIPEDA, we broaden our definition of personal
        information to include any information about an individual, such as
        financial information, information about your appearance, your views and
        opinion (such as those expressed online or through a survey), opinions
        held about you by others, and any personal correspondences you may have
        with us. While this information may not directly identify you, be aware
        that it may be combined with other information to do so.
      </p>
      <p>
        As PIPEDA refers to personal information using the term Personally
        Identifying Information (PII), any references to personal information
        and PII in this privacy policy, and in official communications from
        Noisia Labs OÜ, are intended as equivalent to one another in every way,
        shape and form.
      </p>
      <h4>Valid Consent</h4>
      <p>
        Where you give us consent to collect and use your personal information
        for a specific purpose. You may withdraw your consent at any time using
        the facilities we provide; however this will not affect any use of your
        information that has already taken place. When you contact us, we assume
        your consent based on your positive action of contact, therefore you
        consent to your name and email address being used so we can respond to
        your enquiry. Under PIPEDA, consent is only valid if it is reasonable to
        expect that an individual to whom the organization&apos;s activities are
        directed would understand the nature, purpose, and consequences of the
        collection, use, or disclosure of the personal information to which they
        are consenting.
      </p>
      <p>
        Where you agree to receive marketing communications from us, we will do
        so based solely on your indication of consent or until you instruct us
        not to, which you can do at any time.
      </p>
      <p>
        While you may request that we delete your contact details at any time,
        we cannot recall any email we have already sent. If you have any further
        enquiries about how to withdraw your consent, please feel free to
        enquire using the details provided in the Contact Us section of this
        privacy policy.
      </p>
      <h4>International Transfers of Information</h4>
      <p>
        While Noisia Labs OÜ endeavors to keep, store and handle customer data
        within locations in Canada, it may use agents or service providers
        located in the United States (U.S.), European Economic Area (EEA) or
        United Kingdom (UK) to collect, use, retain and process personal
        information as part of providing services to you. While we use all
        reasonable efforts to ensure that personal information receives the same
        level of security in any other jurisdiction as it would in Canada,
        please be aware that privacy protections under U.S. laws may not be the
        same adequacy.
      </p>
      <h4>Customer Data Rights</h4>
      <p>
        Although PIPEDA does not contain an extensive set of consumer rights, it
        does grant consumers the right to:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Access the personal information organizations hold about them;</li>
        <li>
          Correct any inaccurate or outdated personal information the
          organization hold about them (or, if this is not possible, delete the
          inaccurate personal information)
        </li>
        <li>
          Withdraw consent for any activities for which they have consented
          (e.g. direct marketing or cookies
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h4>Right to Withdraw Consent</h4>
      <p>
        Where you give us consent to collect and use your personal information
        for a specific purpose. Subject to some restrictions, you can, at any
        time, refuse to consent, or continue to consent to the collection, use
        or disclosure of their personal information by notifying us using the
        email address below in the &apos;Contact Us&apos; section. Withdrawal of
        consent may impact our ability to provide or continue to provide
        services.
      </p>
      <p>
        While you may request that we delete your contact details at any time,
        we cannot recall any email we have already sent. If you have any further
        enquiries about how to withdraw your consent, please feel free to
        enquire using the details provided in the Contact Us section of this
        privacy policy.
      </p>
      <h4>Right of Access under PIPEDA</h4>
      <p>
        PIPEDA gives you a general right to access the PII held by businesses
        subject to this law. Under PIPEDA, you need to make your access request
        in writing and pay a minimal fee of $30.00.
      </p>
      <p>
        If any organizational fees seem unjust, you have the right to complain
        about this. We retain the right to decide how we disclose the copies of
        your PII to you. We will take all necessary measures to fulfill your
        request in 30 days from receipt, otherwise we must inform you of our
        inability to do so before the 30-day timeframe if:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          meeting the time limit would unreasonably interfere with our business
          activities; or
        </li>
        <li>
          the time required to undertake consultations necessary to respond to
          the request would make it impractical to meet the time limit.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        We can also extend the time limit for the length of time required to
        convert the personal information into an alternative format. In these
        circumstances, we will advise you of the delay within the first 30 days
        and explain the reason for it.
      </p>
      <h4>Right of rectification under PIPEDA</h4>
      <p>
        You may request a correction to any factual errors or omissions within
        your PII. We would ask you to provide some evidence to back up your
        claim. Under PIPEDA, an organization must amend the information, as
        required, if you successfully demonstrate that it&apos;s incomplete or
        inaccurate.
      </p>
      <p>
        You may contact us at any time, using the information provided in the
        Contact Us section of this privacy policy if you believe your PII on our
        systems is incorrect or incomplete.
      </p>
      <p>
        If we cannot agree on changing the information, you have the right to
        have your concerns recorded with the Office of the Privacy Commission of
        Canada.
      </p>

          <strong>Consent.</strong> Consent is required for Noisia Labs
          OÜ&apos;s collection, use or disclosure of personal information,
          except where required or permitted by PIPEDA or other law. In
          addition, when customers access a product or service offered by us,
          consent is deemed to be granted. Express consent may be obtained
          verbally, in writing or through electronic means. Alternatively,
          consent may be implied through the actions of customers or continued
          use of a product or service following Noisia Labs OÜ&apos;s
          notification of changes.
        </li>
        <li>

          as is necessary to fulfill the purposes for collecting such
          information and compliance with any legal requirements.

        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Safeguards.</strong> We will protect personal information with

          <strong>Openness.</strong> We will make our policies and practices

          information be corrected or updated, if appropriate.
